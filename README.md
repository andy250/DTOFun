Playground for small projects.

DTOMappings - mapping list of DTOs to list of Models (or vice versa). DTOs are various types derived from DTOBase. Models are various types derived from ModelBase. Also should be possible to map list of object (e.g. models bound by MVC model binders) into list of various DTOs (e.g. based on Type property of model).
